Background: in August we observed a sharp drop in follow-on orders. In order to better understand the low numbers for August, following analyses were done to validate/falsify some hypotheses about the root cause. 

I)  For all orders shipped from Mai - Aug 2015, selected the ones, which were preceded by an order shipment within the previous     30 days. This determines the set of "potential follow-on orders". 
    A Tableau graph is provided to show how the ratio of follow-ons vs real-repeats (within this set) developed over time -  
    weekly. 
II) In addition graph of cancelled follow-on orders within this time window is provided in a tableau chart. 
    An analysis is done to check for all follow-on orders that were created during that period; for their parent order id,  
    a check was doen to confirm if the parent order id have received successful DFC (i.e. Direct Feedback Call). 
    The Stacked chart graph will show the number of cancellation for those follow-on orders.
